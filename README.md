# Modified version of Consistency Models Implementation

This is a modified version of CloneofSimo's implementation of Consistency Models where the UNet Class has been modified to allow for feature extraction from bottleneck. In particular more generalized sampling functions have been added in cm_sample.py and some new dataloaders have been added in main.py

Unofficial Implementation of Consistency Models  ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01469)) in pytorch.

Three days ago, legendary man [Yang Song](https://yang-song.net/) released entirely new set of generative model, called consistency models. There aren't yet any open implementations, so here is my attempt at it.


## What are they?

Diffusion models are amazing, because they enable you to sample high fidelity + high diversity images. Downside is, you need lots of steps, something at least 20.

Progressive Distillation (Salimans & Ho, 2022) solves this with distillating 2-steps of the diffusion model down to single step. Doing this N times boosts sampling speed by $2^N$. But is this the only way? Do we need to train diffusion model and distill it $n$ times? Yang didn't think so. Consistency model solves this by mainly trianing a model to make a consistent denosing for different timesteps (Ok I'm obviously simplifying)


## Usage

Install the package with

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/cloneofsimo/consistency_models.git
```

This repo mainly implements consistency training:

$$
L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}[d(f_\theta(x + t_{n + 1}z, t_{n + 1}), f_{\theta_{-}}(x + t_n z, t_n))]
$$

And sampling:

$$
\begin{align}
z &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, I) \\
x &\leftarrow x + \sqrt{t_n ^2 - \epsilon^2} z \\
x &\leftarrow f_\theta(x, t_n) \\
\end{align}
$$


There is a self-contained MNIST training example on the root `main.py`.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Todo

- [x] CIFAR10 Example
- [x] Samples are sooo fuzzy... try to get a crisp result.
